        <h3>Storyline</h3>
        <p>A young widower returns to his hometown to search for answers to his wifeâ€™s murder, which may be linked to the ghost of a murdered ventriloquist.
            Every town has its own ghost story, and a local folktale around Ravens Fair is about a ventriloquist named Mary Shaw. After she went mad in the 1940s, she was accused of kidnapping a young boy who yelled out in one of her performances that she was a fraud. Because of this she was hunted down by townspeople who in the ultimate act of revenge, cut out her tongue and then killed her.</p>
