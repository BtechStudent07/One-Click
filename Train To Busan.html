            leaving him no time to spare with his daughter Su-an. He offers to take her on the train to see her 
            mother in Busan. As the train departs, an abnormal virus spreads from a girl who is infected, and 
            people start to transform to zombies. Will Seok-woo and Su-an make it out alive? TRAIN TO BUSAN is
